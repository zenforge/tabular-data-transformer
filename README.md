# Tabular Data Transformer

A lightweight JavaScript library for transforming and validating tabular data.

## Features âœ¨

- Transforms tabular data (bidimensional arrays e.g, `any[][]`) into object arrays
- Support type inference for `number`, `boolean` and `array` types by default when provided with a schema
- Allows customization by modifying default type converters or adding support for custom types
- Performs basic validation, including checks for `enum` values and `required` fields

## Usage ðŸ’»

### Simplest use case

Tabular to object array data without type inference and validation. Header included in the data.

```js
const tabularData = [
  ["Name", "Age", "Gender"], // header labels included in the first row (you can provide a `header` option if data doesn't have it)
  ["Jane", "22", "Female"], // normal not-typed entry
  ["John", "16", "invalid-option"], // this example doesn't cover validation so "invalid-option" will be accepted
  ["Joe", 39, "Male"], // notice that pre-infered types (age) are supported and preserved
];

const [result] = transformTabularData(tabularData);

console.log(result);
```

#### Output

```js
[
  {
    name: "John",
    age: "16",
    gender: "Male",
  },
  {
    name: "Jane",
    age: "22",
    gender: "Female",
  },
  {
    name: "Joe",
    age: 39,
    gender: "invalid-option",
  },
];
```

## Default Export

### transformTabularData(rows: any[][], options?: TransformTabularDataOptions)

- `rows`: The tabular data to be transformed
- `options?`: Options to customize the transformation process

## Options

### header?: string[]

A list of header labels. It will be used to generate property keys for the result objects.

#### `header` Example

```js
["Full Name", "Birthdate", "Gender", "Interests"];
```

### noHeaderStrategy: "first-row" | "index"

If `header` option is not defined, this option will be used to determine how to generate property keys for the result objects.

- `first-row` (default): Use the first row as header labels
- `index`: Use the column index as properties' key

## schema?: SchemaDefinition

Describes the data and provide guidelines to the output. It is defined using a limited subset of the `JSON schema`. Check the type `SchemaDefinition` for more details.

### `schema` Example

```js
{
  title: "Person",
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    name: {
      type: "string",
    },
    age: {
      type: "number",
    },
    gender: {
      type: "string",
      enum: ["Male", "Female"],
    },
    interests: {
      type: "array",
      items: {
        type: "string",
      },
    },
    employed: {
      type: "boolean",
    }
  },
  required: ["name", "age", "gender"],
}
```
